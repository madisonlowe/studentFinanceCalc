# Student Finance Repayment Calculator

This is a console application which can take in a number of relevant arguments and appropriately return the percentages and amounts of student loan repayments that would be deducted from a given wage.

Huge caveat that the UK student loan system is dark magic, subject to regular change, and none of this in any way constitutes mathematically or programmatically sound financial advice. I'm just getting into C# and wanted something to experiment with the basics on, so here we are!

Currently: the first draft of the code is done, but untidy and in need of a lot of work, which will come next.
